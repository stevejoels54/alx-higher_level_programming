The ``text_indentation`` function
=================================

First import
``text_indentation`` from the ``5-text_indentation`` module:

    >>> from ..5-text_indentation import text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

How to use it:

    >>> text_indentation("Hello. How are you? I am fine.")
    Hello
    How are you
    I am fine

    >>> text_indentation("Hello: How are you? I am fine.")
    Hello
    How are you
    I am fine

    >>> text_indentation("Hello? How are you? I am fine.")
    Hello
    How are you
    I am fine

    >>> text_indentation("This is a test")
    This is a test

    >>> text_indentation("")
    (no output, as the input is an empty string)

    >>> text_indentation(123)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: text must be a string
